## Format

This was started from a genuine interest in Bayesian statistics and causal inference. So this will be autodidactic learning, using McElreath's lectures, and code to help study.

As a stretch goal, we hope to also apply our learnings to a side project or work-related project. As we work through the materials, it has been suggested to also look out for any relevant or related blog posts or articles that involve Bayesian statistics as a way to see how these methods are used in the "wild".

## Schedule

We plan on meeting every two weeks.

## Code

We plan on going through both the R and Python versions of the coding examples:

- Python/PyMC https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc-resources/tree/main/Rethinking_2
- R/Stan https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2024
- R/brms/tidyverse https://bookdown.org/content/4857/
